# Vision

This project aims to provide a lightweight, ethical, and practical framework to identify
security exposure and configuration risks that can lead to real economic loss for organizations.

Unlike traditional vulnerability scanners, this framework focuses on:

- Misconfigurations
- Excessive information exposure
- Weak security posture indicators
- Business-oriented risk interpretation

The goal is not to exploit systems, but to **measure and explain risk** in a way that is:

- Actionable for engineers
- Understandable for decision-makers
- Responsible from an ethical standpoint

This framework is designed for:

- Security engineers
- Blue Team and AppSec roles
- Developers who want to understand the impact of poor hardening
- Educational and defensive security use cases
