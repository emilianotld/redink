# Security Policy

Redink is a **read-only exposure and risk analysis framework**.  
Security is a core concern of both the tool itself and the way it is used.

---

## Supported Versions

Only the latest stable release is supported with security updates.

Older versions may contain unresolved issues and should not be used in sensitive environments.

---

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in Redink itself, please **do not open a public issue**.

Instead, report it responsibly by contacting the maintainer directly.

### How to report

Provide, when possible:

- A clear description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Affected versions

Reports should focus on vulnerabilities **within Redink**, not on targets scanned using the tool.

---

## Scope

This security policy applies to:

- Redink source code
- Dependency usage
- CLI behavior and output handling
- Report generation and data processing

It does **not** cover:

- Vulnerabilities found on scanned targets
- Misuse of the tool outside its documented purpose

---

## Responsible Use

Redink is designed for **defensive and educational purposes only**.

Any attempt to extend the tool toward exploitation, intrusive scanning, or offensive payload delivery is explicitly out of scope and will not be accepted.

---

## Disclosure

Validated security issues will be addressed in a timely manner.  
Public disclosure should only occur after a fix or mitigation is available.
