# Contributing to Redink

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **Redink**.

Redink is designed as a **read-only exposure and risk analysis framework**, with a strong emphasis on clarity, ethics, and professional engineering standards. Contributions are welcome, provided they align with these principles.

## Guiding Principles

All contributions must respect the following:

- **Read-only philosophy**  
  Redink must not include exploitation, payload delivery, or intrusive behavior.

- **Clarity over cleverness**  
  Code should be readable, explicit, and well-documented.

- **Modularity**  
  New features must be self-contained and avoid tight coupling with the core.

- **Auditability**  
  Output, logging, and error handling should remain deterministic and transparent.
